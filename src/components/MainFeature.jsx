import React from 'react';
// Keep the rest of the imports

// The rest of the MainFeature.jsx file should remain unchanged
// Since I don't have the full content of the file, I'm only adding
// the React import at the top, which should resolve the error.

// To properly fix this, you would need to include this import at the top
// of your existing MainFeature.jsx file, keeping all other code the same.
